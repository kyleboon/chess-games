Qb6?? { Blunder. h4 was best. } { Stockfish says. this was a blunder but I did not feel that way during the game. It looked like it forked the d6 pawn and b7 bishop, and I was going to lose the d6 pawn at least, plus the e5 pawn was in trouble. I did briefly consider the computer's suggested move of Bg2 but it didn't appear to be a winning move to me. I missed that after Qg2 I'm threatening mate and forking the d2 rook. This should have ended the game effectively. } (26. h4 g5 27. Ne4 Bxe4 28. Qxe4 gxh4 29. Qxf5 Rxf5 30. Nf3 Nh3+ 31. Kh2 Nhg5 32. Nxg5 Nxg5) 26... Rf7?? { Blunder. Bxg2 was best. } 27.
